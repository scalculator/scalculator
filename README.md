# scalculator
CLI Calculator App written in Scala

## Installation

Java needs to be installed in your system or else Scalculator cannot work! You need to manually install Java first.

**Unix-like Installer (MacOS, Linux, etc):**

Run this in terminal for installation:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalculator/scalculator/main/install.sh)"
```

Run this in terminal for uninstalling:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalculator/scalculator/main/uninstall.sh)"
```

**Windows Installer:**

Not made yet.

**Cannot use an Installer?**

First, make sure Java is installed in your system.

Second, install Scalculator [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalculator/scalculator/main/scalculator.jar).

Third, go to the directory / folder where the `scalculator.jar` file is in, and use the terminal on that folder / directory. After, run `java -jar scalculator.jar`.

For people who aren't very tech savvy or not familiar with the command line or terminal, **please** use the installer, as it is easier to get Scalculator running.
